Data Manipulation Using RegEx Is Match activity.

This workflow explains how to verify the validity of an email address by using the Is Match activity with a custom Regular Expression.

#This is how the RegEx Is Match automation process was built:

1. UiPath Studio was opened and a new Process was created.
2. A Sequence container renamed as RegEx IsMatch was draged in the Workflow Designer.
  .The following variables below were created:

   Variable Name	Variable Type	  Scope           Default Value
   
   varEmail	        String	          RegEx IsMatch   -
   varEmailResult       Boolean	          RegEx IsMatch   -

3. An Is Match activity was dragged inside the Sequence container.
  .In the Properties panel, add the variable varEmail in the Input field.
  .Add the variable varEmailResult in the Result field.
  .Click the Configure Regular Expression button and customize your RegEx. For this example add the expression "((?>[a-zA-Z\d!#$%&'*+\-\/=?^_`{|}~]+\x20*|"((?=[\x01-\x7f])[^"\\]|\\[\x01-\x7f])*"\x20*)*(?<angle><))?((?!\.)(?>\.?[a-zA-Z\d!#$%&'*+\-\/=?^_`{|}~]+)+|"((?=[\x01-\x7f])[^"\\]|\\[\x01-\x7f])*")@(((?!-)[a-zA-Z\d\-]+(?<!-)\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}|\[(((?(?<!\[)\.)(25[0-5]|2[0-4]\d|[01]?\d?\d)){4}|[a-zA-Z\d\-]*[a-zA-Z\d]:((?=[\x01-\x7f])[^\\\[\]]|\\[\x01-\x7f])+)\])(?(angle)>)" in the Value field.

4. Drag an If activity below the Is Match activity.
  .Add the variable varEmailResult in the Condition field.
5. Drag a Message Box activity inside the Then field of the If activity.
  .Add the expression varEmailResult.ToString in the Text field.
6. Drag a Message Box activity inside the Else field of the If activity.
  .Add the expression "my emails" in the Text field.
7. Run the process. The email address added as input is verified and the result is    displayed in a message box.
